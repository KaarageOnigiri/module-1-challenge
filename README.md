# Description
This is Week 1 Challenge by the Ohio State University's bootcamp. Currently, we (the students) will be simplifying the code for this website in order to make it easier for other programmers to read it. Using semantic elements in HTML is proving to be really useful for readability.

## Website
This is a website made for social media marketing purposes, but currently it is being used by the students for their module challenges.
